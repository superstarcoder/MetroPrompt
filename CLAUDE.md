# MetroPrompt — Agentic City Builder

## Project Overview
A pixel-art agentic city builder for a hackathon. The user prompts a **Mayor agent** (Claude Managed Agents) which lays the road network and partitions the grid, then delegates each region in parallel to **Zone sub-agents** that fill it in with specialized attention. The build streams live to the browser via SSE. Future stages: citizens simulate for 7 days, then the Mayor generates a report.

## Hackathon Context
- **Prompt theme:** "Build For What's Next" — interfaces without a name, workflows from a few years out
- **Timeline:** 4 days of hacking (started ~2026-04-22)

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router) — full-stack, API routes for Claude SDK backend. **Breaking changes vs training data** — see `app/AGENTS.md`; consult `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing Next.js code.
- **Rendering:** Pixi.js v8 (vanilla, dynamically imported inside `useEffect`) — WebGL, nearest-neighbor scaling for crisp pixel art
- **Agents:** **Claude Managed Agents** (Anthropic's hosted agent loop). Our placement helpers are exposed as **custom tools** — the Mayor fires `agent.custom_tool_use` events, our backend applies them to the `City` and responds with `user.custom_tool_result`. See `app/lib/agent/mayor.ts`.
- **Streaming:** Two-layer SSE — Anthropic's session event stream → our Next.js route handler (runs the custom-tool loop) → browser EventSource. See `app/app/api/mayor/[sessionId]/stream/route.ts`.
- **Markdown rendering:** `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm` in the chat panel for agent text (Mayor/Zone messages render with full GFM support — lists, tables, code, links, blockquotes). Styles live in `app/app/globals.css` under `.chat-md`.
- **Pixel art:** PixelLab (AI-assisted isometric sprite generation)

## SSR / Client Component Structure
- `page.tsx` — plain server component, imports `CityRendererWrapper`
- `CityRendererWrapper.tsx` — `'use client'`, owns `dynamic(() => import('./CityRenderer'), { ssr: false })`
- `CityRenderer.tsx` — `'use client'`, all Pixi.js logic lives here
- This three-layer pattern is required: `ssr: false` is not allowed in server components, so the dynamic import must live in a client component wrapper

## Agent Architecture
Two-tier multi-agent on Claude Managed Agents: **Mayor** (coordinator) + **Zone** sub-agents (specialists), both on `claude-sonnet-4-6`.

- **Design insight:** LLMs can't reliably emit clean 50×50 ASCII grids, but they're great at structured tool calls. ASCII is dev-only input/output; agents talk to the world via tool calls validated at the call site — `placeProperty` / `placeTileRect` throw on overlap + OOB with structured coordinates that the Mayor (or Zone) reads and retries.
- **Custom-tool pattern:** all our tools are declared on the agent configs (no container execution). Agent emits `agent.custom_tool_use` → our server runs `applyToolCall` (with bbox enforcement for Zones) → sends `user.custom_tool_result`. See §Mayor Agent below.
- **Mayor's job (whole-city builds):** lay road + sidewalk grid → partition the grid into 4–8 non-overlapping zones → call `delegate_zones` ONCE with bbox + free-text instructions per zone → optionally place a few signature buildings or scatter cross-zone landmarks/nature directly → `finish`. The Mayor does NOT fill in zones itself; that's the Zone agents' job.
- **Mayor's job (small edits / partial builds):** place buildings, tiles, or nature directly with the placement tools, no delegation. Configurable in `MAYOR_SYSTEM`.
- **Zone's job:** receive bbox + Mayor's instructions, place buildings + nature inside the bbox, call `finish` when done. Hard bbox enforcement on every tool call (rejects placements outside the assigned region with structured errors so the Zone self-corrects). Zones run in parallel via `Promise.allSettled` — bboxes don't intersect (validated server-side), so concurrent mutation of the shared `City` is safe.
- **Auto-trim of Zone bboxes:** before fan-out, the Mayor's requested bbox for each zone is greedily trimmed inward as long as any edge row/column contains a road/sidewalk/crosswalk/intersection/pavement tile. The Zone receives the trimmed (grass-interior) bbox, so it can never overwrite the Mayor's road network. The Mayor's *original* bbox is what's stored in `completedZoneBboxes` for future-overlap checks (matches the Mayor's mental model of "I claimed this rectangle"). Any trims are reported back to the Mayor in the `delegate_zones` result text under `bbox adjustments:`. See `trimInfrastructureFromBbox` in `mayor.ts`.
- **Grass-only placement rule:** every cell of a building footprint must be grass; nature (tree/flower_patch/bush) can only sit on grass. The handlers in `tools.ts` enforce this with structured errors before mutating the city. Combined with auto-trim, this means Zones effectively own a pure-grass interior and never collide with infrastructure.
- **Model swap:** `MAYOR_MODEL` in `mayor.ts` and `ZONE_MODEL` in `zone.ts` are top-of-file constants. Flip both to `claude-opus-4-7` for demo day — two-line change.

## Build Stages
1. **Data schema** ✅ — `app/lib/all_types.tsx`
2. **Pixel art + rendering system** ✅ — Pixi.js isometric renderer with pan/zoom, grid overlay toggle
3. **Mayor agent via Managed Agents** ✅ — see §Mayor Agent
4. **Connect backend to frontend** ✅ — SSE live build, Build button + Pause + Redirect UI in `CityRenderer.tsx`
5. **Batch tools** ✅ — `place_properties` / `place_tile_rects` / `place_natures` array variants. One Mayor turn lays the entire road grid; one Mayor turn delegates all zones.
6. **Multi-agent split (Mayor + parallel Zone agents)** ✅ — `delegate_zones` Mayor tool + `app/lib/agent/zone.ts`. Hard bbox enforcement, intersection-checked, auto-trim of road borders, runs zones via `Promise.allSettled`.
7. **Nature placement tools** ✅ — `place_nature` / `place_natures` for both Mayor and Zone agents (trees, flower patches, bushes). Grass-only validation enforced by handler.
8. **Chat UI overhaul** ✅ — unified draggable, minimizable pixel-themed chat panel on the right with markdown agent messages and color-coded tool-call cards (auto-grouped by `tool_use_id` prefix so batched calls collapse into a single card).
9. **Remaining polish (deferred)** — `pdf`/`docx` skill for the post-sim report, `web_search` preamble, `code_execution` for sim stats, memory stores for cross-playthrough learning, stream reconnect (MA Pattern 1), per-zone interrupt UI.
10. **7-day citizen simulation + feedback loop** — needs decay, pathfinding, citizens generate feedback → Mayor report

## Rendering System (Stage 2 — complete)

### Isometric coordinate mapping
```ts
gridToScreen(gx, gy) = {
  x: (gx - gy) * (TILE_W / 2),   // TILE_W = 64
  y: (gx + gy) * (TILE_H / 2),   // TILE_H = 32
}
```

### Two-pass render (current approach)
1. **Pass 1 — tiles.** Iterate `city.tile_grid`, decode char via `CODE_TO_TILE`, look up image via `TILE_META[name].image`, draw. Every cell has a ground tile (default grass); buildings sit on top in pass 2 without modifying the tile grid.
2. **Pass 2 — nature + properties.** Merge `city.all_nature` and `city.all_properties` into a combined drawables list, sort by `position.x + position.y` (painter's-algorithm depth), then draw in order. Nature is 1×1 at its position; properties anchor at their top corner and draw with width `prop.width * TILE_W * cfg.scale`.

Because properties anchor at their back corner and the painter's sort uses that anchor, occlusion works for the current test layouts. If future layouts get denser (taller buildings, overlapping footprints), revisit the sort key — may need `max(x+y) - property-depth` or similar.

### Tile rendering
- `anchor.set(0.5, 0)` — top vertex of diamond pinned to grid position
- Scale: `(TILE_W / texture.width) * cfg.scale`
- Offsets per tile type stored in `lib/renderConfig.ts` (`TILE_RENDER`) — keys match `TileName` exactly (`grass`, `road_one_way`, `road_two_way`, `road_intersection`, `crosswalk`, `sidewalk`, `pavement`)
- Texture path resolved via `TILE_META[CODE_TO_TILE[char]].image` — single source of truth in `all_types.tsx`

### Nature rendering
- `Nature` items (`tree`, `flower_patch`, `bush`) are placed by the Mayor or Zone agents via `place_nature` / `place_natures`. The scene starts with no nature; greenery streams in alongside buildings during the build.
- Rendered like tiles: `anchor.set(0.5, 0)`, same scale formula, offsets pulled from `TILE_RENDER` (same record as tiles) keyed by `renderKey(nat.image)` — e.g. `tree_v3`, `flower_patch_v1`, `bush_v1`.
- Server stores the default variant (`TREE_IMAGES[0]` etc); the browser picks a random variant via `pickNatureImage` for visual variety, mirroring the property-variant roulette.

### Property rendering
- `anchor.set(0.5, 0)` — top vertex of footprint diamond pinned to grid position
- Width: `prop.width * TILE_W * cfg.scale`; y scale matches x (`sprite.scale.y = sprite.scale.x`)
- Y adjusted by `-(prop.width - 1) * TILE_H` to correct for building height above footprint
- Render key derived from image path via `renderKey(prop.image)` — strips path and size suffix: `/assets/apartment_v1_3_3.png` → `apartment_v1`
- **Placement convention:** `(gx, gy)` = top corner of diamond footprint. A 3×3 property at (0,0) occupies cells (0,0)–(2,2).

### Texture loading
- Tile textures keyed by image path — `tileTex['/assets/grass_1_1.png']`, collected from `ALL_TILE_IMAGES`
- Property textures keyed by image path — `propTex['/assets/apartment_v1_3_3.png']`, collected from `ALL_PROP_IMAGES` (`PROPERTY_DEFAULTS` ∪ `HOUSE_IMAGES` ∪ `APARTMENT_IMAGES` ∪ `OFFICE_IMAGES`)
- Nature textures keyed by image path — `natureTex['/assets/tree_v3_1_1.png']`, collected from `ALL_NATURE_IMAGES` (`TREE_IMAGES` ∪ `FLOWER_PATCH_IMAGES` ∪ `BUSH_IMAGES`)
- All unique paths collected at module top and loaded in parallel via `Assets.load` so `tool_applied` events render immediately without load gaps

### Scene lifecycle (`CityRenderer.tsx`)
- `GRID_SIZE = 50` (50×50 demo grid; real `City` schema uses 500×500).
- **Empty on mount** — `cityRef.current = initCity(50)` (all grass, no buildings). The scene fills in live as the Mayor streams tool events.
- **Textures preloaded upfront** — every possible tile + property variant (`ALL_TILE_IMAGES`, `ALL_PROP_IMAGES` at module top), so `tool_applied` events render immediately without load gaps.
- **Re-render scheduling** — each `tool_applied` event mutates `cityRef.current` via `placeProperty` / `placeTileRect` / `placeNature`, then calls `scheduleRender()` which coalesces to a single `requestAnimationFrame` (so a batch of 10 tool calls per Mayor turn = one repaint, not ten).
- **Two-layer world container** — `world > spritesLayer + gridLines`. Repaints clear `spritesLayer.removeChildren()` only; `gridLines` survives.
- **Client-side variant roulette** — when the Mayor emits `place_property(apartment, …)` the browser picks a random image from `APARTMENT_IMAGES` for visual variety. The server's parallel copy uses `PROPERTY_DEFAULTS[name].image`. They diverge only on cosmetic variant — not on structure.

### Pixi.js v8 notes
- Must be dynamically imported inside `useEffect`: `const { Application, ... } = await import('pixi.js')`
- `TextureStyle.defaultOptions.scaleMode = 'nearest'` — set before loading any textures for crisp pixel art
- `await app.init({...})` — async init required in v8
- `app.canvas` (not `app.view`) for the canvas element

### renderConfig.ts
Separates visual tuning from game logic. Contains per-sprite `{ offsetX, offsetY, scale }` for all tile, nature, and property render keys. Edit this file to adjust sprite alignment without touching the schema or renderer logic.

Keys use the sprite variant name (same as what `renderKey()` derives from the image path):
- Tile keys: `grass`, `road_one_way`, `road_two_way`, `road_intersection`, `crosswalk`, `sidewalk`, `pavement` — match `TileName` exactly
- Nature keys: `tree_v1`–`tree_v4`, `flower_patch_v1`, `bush_v1`
- Property keys: `park`, `hospital`, `school`, `grocery_store`, `fire_station`, `police_station`, `powerplant`, `restaurant`, `shopping_mall`, `theme_park`, `apartment_v1`, `apartment_v2`, `office_v1`–`office_v3`, `home_v1`, `home_v2` (note: `home_`, not `house_` — matches image filenames; the `powerplant` key also differs from the `power_plant` property name)

## Data Schema (`app/lib/all_types.tsx`)
All types and constants are exported. Import via `@/lib/all_types`.

### Tiles (`TileName`)
`pavement`, `road_one_way`, `road_two_way`, `road_intersection`, `crosswalk`, `sidewalk`, `grass`

Tiles have no per-instance state — they live in `city.tile_grid: TileCode[][]` as single-char codes. `TILE_META[name]` provides the per-name `{ can_walk_through, can_drive_through, image }` used by rendering and (eventually) pathfinding. There is no `Tile` object type anymore.

### Nature (`NatureName`) — separate from tiles
`tree`, `flower_patch`, `bush`. `Nature = { name, position, image }` — no walkability flags (enforced by rendering / pathfinding).

Variant image arrays:
- `TREE_IMAGES` — `tree_v1_1_1.png` – `tree_v4_1_1.png`
- `FLOWER_PATCH_IMAGES` — `flower_patch_v1_1_1.png`
- `BUSH_IMAGES` — `bush_v1_1_1.png`

### Properties (`PropertyName`) and stats
`Property = { name, position, width, height, is_enterable, current_occupants, capacity, boredom_decrease, hunger_decrease, tiredness_decrease, image }`.

| Property | Size | Cap | Enterable | Boredom↓ | Hunger↓ | Tiredness↓ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `park` | 3×3 | 50 | ✅ | 8 | 0 | 3 |
| `hospital` | 3×3 | 20 | ✅ | 0 | 0 | 5 |
| `school` | 3×3 | 80 | ✅ | 3 | 0 | 0 |
| `grocery_store` | 3×3 | 30 | ✅ | 2 | 8 | 0 |
| `house` | 2×2 | 4 | ✅ | 2 | 5 | 10 |
| `apartment` | 3×3 | 10 | ✅ | 2 | 5 | 10 |
| `office` | 3×3 | 30 | ✅ | 3 | 0 | 0 |
| `restaurant` | 2×2 | 30 | ✅ | 5 | 10 | 0 |
| `fire_station` | 3×3 | 10 | ❌ | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| `police_station` | 3×3 | 10 | ❌ | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| `power_plant` | 3×3 | 5 | ❌ | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| `shopping_mall` | 3×3 | 40 | ✅ | 6 | 6 | 0 |
| `theme_park` | 3×3 | 60 | ✅ | 10 | 2 | 0 |

Variant image arrays:
- `HOUSE_IMAGES` — `home_v1_1_1.png`, `home_v2_2_2.png`
- `APARTMENT_IMAGES` — `apartment_v1_3_3.png`, `apartment_v2_3_3.png`
- `OFFICE_IMAGES` — `office_v1_3_3.png`, `office_v2_3_3.png`, `office_v3_3_3.png`

### Important: no Math.random() at module level
`PROPERTY_DEFAULTS` uses index `[0]` for variant buildings. Random variant selection happens inside `useEffect` / on tool-event handlers (e.g. `pickPropertyImage` in `CityRenderer.tsx`), never at module evaluation time — doing so causes React hydration mismatches.

### People (`Person`)
`name`, `age_group` (`adult`/`child`), `job` (see `Job` union, `null` for children), `home: Property`, `current_location: Position`, `current_path: Position[]`, `inside_property: Property | null`, needs `hunger`/`boredom`/`tiredness` (1–10) with per-person decay rates `hunger_rate` (1.5–4.5), `boredom_rate`/`tiredness_rate` (1.0–4.0), plus `image`.

Helpers:
- `JOB_OPTIONS` — all non-null jobs (`teacher`, `doctor`, `firefighter`, `police_officer`, `chef`, `grocer`, `engineer`, `unemployed`)
- `randomBetween(min, max)`
- `spawnPerson(age_group, home, availableImages)` — assigns random job (null for children), randomized needs/rates, picks image from supplied list. Depends on an external `generateRandomName()` (declared, not yet implemented).

### Grid and City — three-list design
`City` is a flat tile grid plus parallel lists for buildings, nature, and citizens. The tile grid stores only ground chars; buildings and nature live in their own lists keyed by anchor position. This keeps storage compact, matches the renderer's natural iteration, and makes a single char grid the source of truth for the LLM-facing ASCII view.

```ts
City = {
  tile_grid: TileCode[][];    // ground layer; every cell defaults to '.' (grass)
  all_properties: Property[]; // buildings (anchor + variant + occupants)
  all_nature: Nature[];       // trees / flowers / bushes
  all_citizens: Person[];
  day: number;                // 1–7
}
```

Helpers (all in `all_types.tsx`):
- `initCity(size = 500)` — all-grass grid, empty lists. `size` is parameterized so the renderer uses 50×50.
- `placeTile(city, x, y, name: TileName)` — sets `tile_grid[y][x] = TILE_CODES[name]`. No validation (fast).
- `placeTileRect(city, x1, y1, x2, y2, name: TileName)` — fills a rectangle (corners inclusive, normalized). **Throws** on OOB with grid dims in the message. This is the Mayor's primary ground-paint brush.
- `placeProperty(city, property)` — **throws** on OOB or footprint overlap with an existing property, with both building names + coordinates in the error. Pushes to `all_properties` on success. Does **not** touch `tile_grid`; buildings sit on grass by convention.
- `placeNature(city, nature)` — pushes to `all_nature`. No validation at this layer; the grass-only and "no overlap with building" checks live in `tools.ts → handlePlaceNature`.
- `getTileAt(city, position): TileName` — decodes via `CODE_TO_TILE`. Used by `handlePlaceProperty` to scan the footprint for non-grass cells and by `handlePlaceNature` for the grass check.
- `getPropertyAt(city, position): Property | undefined` — O(n) scan over `all_properties` for a footprint covering `position`. Used by `handlePlaceNature` to reject building-occupied cells.

### TileCode — single-char codes
`TILE_CODES`, `NATURE_CODES`, `PROPERTY_CODES` are the forward maps (name → char). `CODE_TO_TILE`, `CODE_TO_NATURE`, `CODE_TO_PROPERTY` are their inverses. Uppercase = buildings, lowercase = nature, symbols = ground tiles. `H` = hospital (universal map convention); house is `D`.

| Ground | Nature | Buildings |
|---|---|---|
| `.` grass | `t` tree | `D` house · `A` apartment · `O` office · `R` restaurant |
| `,` pavement | `f` flower_patch | `P` park · `S` school · `G` grocery_store · `H` hospital |
| `-` road_one_way | `b` bush | `F` fire_station · `C` police_station · `E` power_plant |
| `=` road_two_way | | `M` shopping_mall · `Z` theme_park |
| `+` road_intersection | | |
| `x` crosswalk | | |
| `_` sidewalk | | |

### LLM-facing view: `cityToAscii(city)` and `asciiToCity(ascii, opts?)`
- **`cityToAscii(city) → { grid, legend }`** — `grid` overlays nature and properties onto a copy of `tile_grid` (properties stamp their char across their whole footprint so the LLM sees size/shape), joined with newlines. `legend` is the static `ASCII_LEGEND` string. At 50×50 the grid is ~2.5k chars (fits easily); at 500×500 it's 250k and needs a viewport or block-level summary.
- **`asciiToCity(ascii, opts?) → City`** — inverse parser, used as a dev/test utility (not wired into the agent pipeline). Strict: throws with `(x, y)` on ragged rows, malformed multi-cell property footprints, overlaps, or unknown chars. `opts.variantStrategy` is `'default'` (deterministic, SSR-safe) or `'random'` (client-only) for picking variant images.

## Mayor + Zone Agents (`app/lib/agent/`)

### Tool set
The Mayor has 8 tools; Zones have 7 (no `delegate_zones` — recursion banned).

| Tool | Mayor | Zone | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `place_property(property, x, y)` | ✅ | ✅ | One building. Rejects on overlap, OOB, or any non-grass cell in the footprint (Zone also checks bbox). |
| `place_properties(properties[])` | ✅ | ✅ | Many buildings, one call. Per-item validation, partial-success result. |
| `place_tile_rect(tile, x1, y1, x2, y2)` | ✅ | ✅ | One ground-tile rectangle. |
| `place_tile_rects(rects[])` | ✅ | ✅ | Many rects, one call. Mayor lays the entire road grid in one of these. |
| `place_nature(nature, x, y)` | ✅ | ✅ | One 1×1 tree/flower_patch/bush. Rejected if not on a grass tile or if a building covers the cell (Zone also checks bbox). |
| `place_natures(natures[])` | ✅ | ✅ | Many nature items, one call. Per-item validation, partial-success result. |
| `delegate_zones(zones[])` | ✅ | ❌ | Mayor-only. `zones: [{bbox, instructions}, ...]`. Validates + auto-trims bboxes server-side then fans out to parallel Zone sessions via `Promise.allSettled`. |
| `finish(reason)` | ✅ | ✅ | Ends the agent's loop. Mayor's `finish` ends the build; Zone's `finish` ends just that Zone session. |

### `tools.ts`
- `ToolCall` discriminated union for the singletons (`place_property` | `place_tile_rect` | `place_nature` | `finish`). Batch tools and `delegate_zones` are handled inline in `mayor.ts` / `zone.ts` rather than expanding the union.
- Handlers (`handlePlaceProperty`, `handlePlaceTileRect`, `handlePlaceNature`, `handleFinish`) — wrap the throwing placement helpers into `{ ok: true }` / `{ ok: false, error }`, plus enforce the **grass-only rule** (every footprint cell or nature target must be `grass`; rejection includes the offending cell + its current tile name).
- `applyToolCall(city, call) → ToolResult` — central dispatcher used by both Mayor and Zone loops.
- `TOOL_SCHEMAS` — full JSON-schema list passed to the Mayor's `agents.create({ tools })`. Includes `delegate_zones`, `place_nature`, `place_natures`.
- `ZONE_TOOL_SCHEMAS` — `TOOL_SCHEMAS` minus `delegate_zones`. Passed to the Zone's `agents.create({ tools })`. Same identity as `TOOL_SCHEMAS` after filtering — easy to keep in sync.

### `mayor.ts`
- `MAYOR_MODEL` constant (top of file) — flip to `claude-opus-4-7` for demo day.
- `MAYOR_SYSTEM` prompt — distinct strategy branches for "build whole city" (lay infra → partition → `delegate_zones` → optional landmarks → `finish`) vs "edit / partial" (place directly, no delegation). Includes guidance on encoding spatial context (road borders, neighbor character) into each zone's `instructions` string since Zones don't see the rest of the city.
- `ensureMayor()` — create-or-reuse pattern for the Mayor agent + the shared environment. Reads `MAYOR_AGENT_ID` / `MAYOR_ENV_ID` from env; if missing, creates them and logs the IDs to paste into `.env.local`.
- `createMayorSession(goal)` — `sessions.create()`, stashes `{ city: initCity(50), pendingGoal, interrupted: false, completedZoneBboxes: [] }` in a module-level `sessions` Map.
- `runMayorLoop(sessionId, onEvent)` — stream-first: opens `events.stream()`, sends the kickoff `user.message` after. For each `agent.custom_tool_use`:
  - Singletons → `applyToolCall`, send tool_result.
  - `place_properties` / `place_tile_rects` / `place_natures` → unroll into per-item synthetic `tool_applied` events for the frontend (each tagged with `${event.id}#${i}` so the UI can group), send a single composite `tool_result` text back to MA.
  - `delegate_zones` → normalize bboxes, validate (in-grid + intra-batch no-intersect + no-intersect with `state.completedZoneBboxes`), then **auto-trim** each bbox via `trimInfrastructureFromBbox` (peels road/sidewalk/crosswalk/intersection/pavement off the edges), skips zones with no grass interior, fans out the trimmed bboxes to `runZoneBuild()` via `Promise.allSettled`, aggregates summaries (including a `bbox adjustments:` block listing trims), appends each Mayor's *original* bbox (pre-trim) to `completedZoneBboxes`. Validation failures return a structured error so the Mayor retries without spawning anything.
  - `finish` → terminate loop.
  - Turn cap = `MAX_CUSTOM_TOOL_USES = 70`. Counts at the tool-call level, so a `place_properties` with 30 items or a `delegate_zones` with 6 zones each = 1 against the cap.
- Helpers `INFRA_TILES`, `isInfrastructure`, `trimInfrastructureFromBbox` live at the top of `mayor.ts` — the trim is a greedy four-edge peel that loops until every edge row/column is pure grass (or the bbox collapses, in which case it returns null and the zone is skipped).
- `sendInterrupt(sessionId)` / `sendRedirect(sessionId, text)` — same UI pause/redirect mechanics as before. Note: only the Mayor's session is interruptible; Zones run to their own `finish`.
- `MayorStreamEvent` is a discriminated union: `anthropic_event` | `tool_applied` (with optional `source: 'mayor' | 'zone'` tag) | `zone_message` | `done`.

### `zone.ts`
- `ZONE_MODEL` constant (same Sonnet 4.6 by default).
- `ZONE_SYSTEM` prompt — terse: "you own this bbox, here are your instructions, place buildings + nature, call finish." Documents the GRASS-ONLY RULE and HARD BBOX RULE inline so the model knows what'll be rejected. Includes density guidance: pack buildings tight (one tile of grass between for fire safety), spread civic infrastructure across roads, scatter ~10–25 nature items per zone.
- `ensureZone()` — create-or-reuse the Zone agent. Reads `ZONE_AGENT_ID` from env; if missing, logs the new ID for `.env.local`. Reuses `MAYOR_ENV_ID` (env passed in by the Mayor's handler — no separate environment).
- `runZoneBuild(bbox, instructions, city, envId, zoneIndex, onEvent) → ZoneBuildResult`:
  - `sessions.create()` with the Zone agent.
  - Kickoff message: just (auto-trimmed) bbox + Mayor's instructions + "place buildings, prefer batch, call finish when done." No full-city ASCII (intentionally — see "Why no ASCII for Zones" below).
  - Custom-tool loop with bbox validation on every singleton + batch tool call (per-item for batches). `bboxContainsProperty` for buildings, `bboxContainsTileRect` for tile rects, `bboxContainsPosition` for nature. Out-of-bbox calls return `(x,y) is outside your zone bbox (x1,y1)-(x2,y2)` so the Zone self-corrects.
  - Tracks placement counts by type for the summary ("ok: 14 placements — 8 house, 2 apartment, 1 park, 3 restaurant" — counts include nature).
  - Forwards `tool_applied` and `zone_message` events upstream via `onEvent` so the browser renders Zone placements live through the same SSE pipe.
- `Bbox = { x1, y1, x2, y2 }` exported type. Bboxes are normalized (min/max corners) and infrastructure-trimmed by the Mayor before being passed to `runZoneBuild`, so Zone code can assume `x1 ≤ x2, y1 ≤ y2` and that the bbox interior is pure grass at delegation time.

### Why no ASCII for Zones
Initial design passed `cityToAscii(city)` in the Zone kickoff so the agent could see roads + neighbors. Removed because: (a) it added ~2.5K chars per zone session, mostly never referenced; (b) the Zone's whole point is *focused attention on its bbox*, and dumping the full city dilutes that; (c) the Mayor already sees the full map and can encode any needed spatial context (road borders, neighbor character) directly into each zone's `instructions` string. Cleaner mental model, smaller prompt, better outputs in practice.

### API routes (`app/app/api/mayor/`)
- **`POST /api/mayor`** — body `{ goal: string }` → `{ sessionId }`. Calls `createMayorSession(goal)`.
- **`GET /api/mayor/[sessionId]/stream`** — SSE. Opens a `ReadableStream`, runs `runMayorLoop` server-side, forwards each `MayorStreamEvent` as `event: mayor\ndata: <json>\n\n`. Browser narrows by `payload.kind`: `anthropic_event` | `tool_applied` (mayor or zone) | `zone_message` | `done`.
- **`POST /api/mayor/[sessionId]/interrupt`** — wraps `sendInterrupt` (Mayor only — Zones not interruptible).
- **`POST /api/mayor/[sessionId]/message`** — body `{ text: string }`. Wraps `sendRedirect`.

All four routes return `{ error: "..." }` with 404/400/500 on unknown sessionId / missing fields / server error.

### Frontend integration (`components/CityRenderer.tsx`)
- **Unified chat panel (top-right by default, draggable + minimizable, pixel themed):** one `w-[26rem] h-[75vh]` card combines status, agent feed, tool-call cards, and the controls dock. Header is the drag handle (`onMouseDown` → `dragStateRef`, window-level `mousemove`/`mouseup` listeners update `panelPos` until release, clamped to viewport). A `_` / `▢` button toggles `minimized`, which unmounts the feed + composer and drops the height class so the panel collapses to the header bar.
- **Composer dock** at the bottom of the panel switches by status:
  - `idle` / `done` → goal textarea + cyan **▶ Build**.
  - `running` → goal textarea (disabled) + amber **❚❚ Pause Mayor**.
  - `paused` → pulsing amber badge + redirect textarea + emerald **▶ Resume with nudge**.
- **Feed entries** are a `FeedItem` discriminated union: `{ kind: 'message', author: 'mayor' | 'zone', text }` rendered through `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm` inside a `.chat-md` card, OR `{ kind: 'tool_batch', name, source, items[] }` rendered as a color-coded compact card (fuchsia `▣` properties, amber `▭` tiles, emerald `✿` nature, sky `✓` finish) with an `[MAYOR/ZONE] · ▣ name ×N` header and per-item rows like `› apartment @ (12,8)` (failures show in rose with the error inline). Cards auto-grouped by `tool_use_id.split('#')[0]` so a 30-item `place_properties` collapses into a single card with `+ N more…`. Auto-scroll on new entries.
- **Build flow:** clears local `cityRef` and `feed`, POSTs `/api/mayor`, opens `new EventSource(.../stream)`, listens for `event: mayor`. On each `tool_applied` it (1) pushes to the feed via `pushToolApplied`, (2) if `result.ok === true`, calls `placeProperty` / `placeTileRect` / `placeNature` against the local city and `scheduleRender()`. `agent.message` events push a `mayor` message; `zone_message` events push a `zone` message. The `source` tag on `tool_applied` is purely for labeling — frontend handles Mayor and Zone events identically.
- During multi-zone builds, several quadrants fill in concurrently rather than corner-to-corner — clear visual signal that parallel Zone agents are working.
- Pixi pan/zoom handlers ignore events whose target is inside `[data-mayor-ui]`, so the chat panel and grid toggle don't pan the canvas.

### Environment variables (`app/.env.local`)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — required.
- `MAYOR_AGENT_ID`, `MAYOR_ENV_ID`, `ZONE_AGENT_ID` — persist after first boot. Missing IDs trigger fresh `agents.create()` / `environments.create()` calls; the new IDs are logged to the dev console for the user to paste into `.env.local`. **Drop the relevant ID(s) and restart whenever the agent's tool list or system prompt changes** (the agent config on Anthropic's side is immutable per version; we don't currently call `agents.update`).

### Known limitations (deferred polish)
- **Reconnect mid-stream not supported.** Server-side loop guards against double-attach with a `running` flag. Browser drop mid-build → loop completes server-side but a new page can't re-attach. Fix: MA client Pattern 1 (`events.list()` + dedupe on reconnect).
- **Zone sessions not interruptible from UI.** Pause button halts the Mayor; Zones already-spawned run to their own `finish`. Zone-level interrupt would need its own UI surface.
- **Single-user demo assumption.** Module-level `sessions` Map is per-process. Two browser tabs can coexist with different sessions but not multi-tenant.
- **Agent config drift.** Changing `MAYOR_SYSTEM`, `ZONE_SYSTEM`, or any tool schema requires deleting the corresponding `*_AGENT_ID` from `.env.local` and restarting. Faster long-term: call `client.beta.agents.update()` on boot.

## Key Design Notes
- Citizens have needs that decay over time; buildings satisfy those needs — the city either *works* or *fails*, not just gets built
- `fire_station` / `police_station` / `power_plant` are not enterable and have no need-decrease stats (risk/utility infrastructure)
- `current_path: Position[]` supports pathfinding — citizens visibly walk to buildings
- `day: 1–7` implies a weekly simulation cycle
- Pathfinding (A* or similar) on the 500×500 grid is a non-trivial Stage 5 concern — plan for it early
